    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>I enjoy programming, particularly to create new things or enhance my students' classroom experience.</p>
    <h2>Reading</h2>    
        <p>I particularly enjoy science fiction, fantasy, and military history, but I read a wide variety of books.</p>
    <h2>Networking and Security</h2>    
        <p>Exploring coding also led me to find courses in networking and security, which I am really enjoying learning about on the side.</p>
    <h2>Houseplants</h2>    
        <p>Creating a green oasis at my home with a collection of thriving houseplants. I am most proud of my Philodendron "Mia," which I bought because it had the same name as my daughter.</p>
    <h2>Board Gaming</h2>    
        <p>My friends and I meet frequently to try out different strategic board games. I particularly like Scythe and Thunderstone.</p>
